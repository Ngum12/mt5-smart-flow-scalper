## ⚙️ Trading Logic

### 🔵 Entry Signals

#### BUY:
- EMA short crosses above EMA long
- RSI exits oversold zone
- MACD line crosses above signal line

#### SELL:
- EMA short crosses below EMA long
- RSI exits overbought zone
- MACD line crosses below signal line

### 🟡 Exit Mechanisms

#### ✅ Take Profit:
- Automatic based on risk-reward & ATR
- Formula:
  - BUY: `TP = entry + (ATR × multiplier × RR)`
  - SELL: `TP = entry - (ATR × multiplier × RR)`

#### ❌ Stop Loss:
- ATR-based to match market volatility
- Formula:
  - BUY: `SL = entry - (ATR × multiplier)`
  - SELL: `SL = entry + (ATR × multiplier)`

#### 🔄 Trailing Stop:
- Moves SL in the direction of profit
- Locks in profits while staying in trend
