Trading Logic
The Smart Flow Scalper system makes trading decisions based on the following logic:

Entry Signals
BUY Signals
EMA short crosses above EMA long
RSI moves from oversold to neutral territory
MACD line crosses above signal line
SELL Signals
EMA short crosses below EMA long
RSI moves from overbought to neutral territory
MACD line crosses below signal line
Exit Mechanisms
The system has multiple ways to exit trades:

Take Profit (Profitable Exit):

Each trade is placed with an automatic take profit level
For BUY trades: take_profit = entry_price + (atr_multiplier * atr_value * risk_reward_ratio)
For SELL trades: take_profit = entry_price - (atr_multiplier * atr_value * risk_reward_ratio)
Profit Target: Typically 1.5-2x the risk amount (configurable risk-reward ratio)
Stop Loss (Loss Protection):

Each trade has a protective stop loss order
For BUY trades: stop_loss = entry_price - (atr_multiplier * atr_value)
For SELL trades: stop_loss = entry_price + (atr_multiplier * atr_value)
Based on ATR (Average True Range) to adapt to market volatility
Limits losses to a pre-defined percentage of account (usually 1%)
Dynamic Trailing Stop:

For winning trades, the stop loss moves in the direction of the trade
Secures profits while allowing trades to run
